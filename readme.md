## Simple JS Injector

This addon creates a small popup that lets you paste some JS code and inject it into the page you are currently seeing. 

This is a copycat Firefox version of JS injector from [Daniel Han](https://github.com/hex0cter/js-injector). It is [only available in Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/javascript-injector/ejnccfcackblkelbafbolcpjfpcmbplg) so I updated it and adapted it to work with Firefox.

You can check his GitHub page [here](https://github.com/hex0cter)

Get it on Firefox [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/simple-javascript-injector/)
