## Simple JS Injector

This addon creates a small popup that lets you paste some JS code and inject it into the page you are currently seeing. 

This is an adaptation to Firefox version of the Chrome extension "JS injector" from  [Daniel Han](https://github.com/hex0cter/js-injector). It is [only available in Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/javascript-injector/ejnccfcackblkelbafbolcpjfpcmbplg) so I updated it and adapted it to work with Firefox.

You can check his GitHub page [here](https://github.com/hex0cter)

Get it on Firefox [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/simple-javascript-injector/)
